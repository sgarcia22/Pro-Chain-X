# Pro Chain X

Submission to the Polygon X Encode Hackathon 2022. 

Pro Chain X is a **multiplayer enabled e-sports battle arena**, where players must navigate an arduous map using parkour mechanics. Gaming is a billion dollar industry growing faster by the day. E-sports has been proven to be a popular way to watch players enhance and overcome obstacles in games. Pro Chain X was made with the purpose to onboard more folks onto web3 by providing a gamified approach with real-life incentives. 

## How It Works

Players connect to the game through their wallets and are able to buy NFTs on the Mumbai Testnet to give them access to compete in the arena. Once they are granted access they can enter the queue, and the countdown will begin. Spectators can bet on the winning player by inputting their wallet address and the amount they want to bet. The bet gets placed in a pool where the funds are distributed after the winner is decided. Spectators can watch the game real-time through the Arena Hub.
